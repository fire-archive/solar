P/Dev/ (where dev happens)
P/Run/ (where testing happens)
P/Docs/ (if wanted)
P/Dev/Source/ (your game source)
P/Dev/Tools/ (put libraries here)
P/Dev/Project (makefiles/ project files etc)
P/Run/Data (Game assets data that will be shipped with the game)
P/Run/User (Game created files / configurations etc 'user data')
That is pretty much the jist of it.
