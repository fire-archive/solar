# BCIT Games Development Club Solar project specification

Project start date: Sat 16 Jun 2012 19:32:48 PDT.

Project end date: Six week deadline from June 12 which is July 12, 2012 PDT.

The story of the game is simply:

A young child has to get from one side of the field to the other without getting burned.

## The game consists of two parts:

### First Part:

Its a very simple point and click where the preschooler has to select the four items that is required for him/her to go outside (which in this case is a very simple animation of a little boy or girl). These items will be the hat, sunglasses, long sleeve t-shirt and sunscreen.

### Second Part:

The second part is a simple side scroller where the character has to walk from one side of the field to the other. There will be a “sunburn” meter at the top of the screen and the sun will rise and fall and the character has to get to the other side by dark. Along the way the character has to get under the shade in order to reduce sunburn OR collect sun screen bottles. The sunburn meter will keep rising if the child does not go to cover or get more sunscreen.
